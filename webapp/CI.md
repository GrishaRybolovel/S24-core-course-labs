# CI Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for optimizing CI workflows in the repository.

## Workflow Status Badge

Add a workflow status badge to the repository's README.md file to provide visibility into the current status of the CI workflow.

## Best Practices

- **Modular Workflows**: Break down workflows into smaller, modular steps for easier debugging and maintenance.
- **Environment Variables and Secrets**: Use environment variables and secrets to store sensitive information securely.
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Implement caching to speed up workflow execution by caching dependencies and build artifacts.
- **Parallel Jobs**: Use parallel jobs or steps to run tasks concurrently and reduce overall workflow execution time.

## Example: Caching Python Dependencies

```yaml
- name: Cache Python dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```
