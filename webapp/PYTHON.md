# Django Framework

## Why

For this assignment particularly, using Django is a bit overcomplicated way, because we can use less code and time and do it with Flask, for example. But I decided to choose django because I use Django in my work, and it will be easier for me to do next assignments.

## In addition

It would be easier for me to use Django is really powerful framework with a lot of features, such as Django ORM, Django REST technology for APIs.

## About the app itself(best practices)

### 1. MVC
Django use MVC design pattern, like the most part of the frameworks. So, for the time I created a new app "msk_time", which has a view that contains a View class with get method that returns a JSON with current Moscow time.
