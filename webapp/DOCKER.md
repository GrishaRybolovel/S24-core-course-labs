# Docker Best Practices

This document outlines the Docker best practices employed within the `Dockerfile` for the Python Django application located in the `webapp` folder.

## Dockerfile Overview

The `Dockerfile` defines the steps to build a Docker image for running a Python Django application.

## Best Practices Employed

### 1. Use of Official Base Image

We start with an official Python image (`python:3-alpine3.15`) as the base image, which provides a lightweight Python environment based on Alpine Linux.

### 2. Minimization of Layers

To minimize the number of layers, similar commands such as `RUN` and `COPY` are grouped together, reducing the overall size of the Docker image and improving build efficiency.

### 3. Rootless Container

A non-root user (`myuser`) is created within the Docker image to run the application, enhancing security by reducing the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

### 4. Selective File Copying

Specific files, such as `requirements.txt`, are copied into the Docker image first to leverage Docker's layer caching mechanism. This ensures that only necessary files are copied, optimizing build times.

### 5. Precise Version of Base Image and Language

We use a precise version of the base image (`python:3-alpine3.15`) to ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments. This reduces the risk of compatibility issues and unexpected behavior.
